# Introduction

[Yojee](https://wwww.yojee.com) is a cloud based (SaaS) logistics platform that seamlessly and uniquely manages, tracks and optimises freight movements along the entire logistics chain, from sender to end customer, across borders and between logistics providers (land, sea, air), with subcontractors and for multi-leg journeys. Rarely is a single carrier servicing an entire goods journey from sender to end customer, or exclusively using one type of transportation method. Yojee ensures connectivity and more efficient planning along the entire journey.

Users typically interact with Yojee through a Dispatcher portal, a Driver's mobile application or via our APIs. Other than these methods, we also provide integration with other platform via Yojee apps such as:
